## Introduction

The device is capable of measuring the following metrics like temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, CO2 concentration, TVOC concentration, UVA/UVB as well as the light level. Those metrics can then be used for further smart home automations or just for monitoring your indor environments.

## Electrical Components

Electrical components and their interconnection used for zthis project can be found in the following schematic. The operating brain of the smart home sytsem is a ordinary ESP8266 Chip on the Node MCU v3 development board. The Sensors used inside the device can be seen in the following table with their measured quantities.

| Board Name | Sensor Name  | Metric | Units |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| DEBO Sens BME860  | Bosch BME860 | Temperature, Humidity, Air Pressure | Â°C, %, mPas   |
| GUVA-S12SD        | GUVA-S12SD   | UVA / UVB                           | UV Index               |
| DEBO BH1750       | BH 1750      | Luminous flux                       | lm                     |
| DEBO Sens CCS811  | CCS811       | CO2, TVOC                           | ppm, ppb               | 

For usage without the need of a internet connection 5 RGB leds of the Type W2812B are used in order to disply a color code. This color code identifies the sensor and if predefined boundary values where exceeded. A Blue color is shown for values that are smaller than a predefined minimum, a red color is shown if a sensor value is higehr than a maximum pe defined value and a green color is shown if a sensor values is its defined beoundary. The position of the light indicates the actual sensor metric. This setup can be customized by any user in the Arduino code.
