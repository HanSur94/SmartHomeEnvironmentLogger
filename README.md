## Introduction

The device is capable of measuring the following metrics like temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, CO2 concentration, TVOC concentration, UVA/UVB as well as the light level. Those metrics can then be used for further smart home automations or just for monitoring your indor environments.

## Electrical Components

Electrical components and their interconnection used for zthis project can be found in the following schematic. The operating brain of the smart home sytsem is a ordinary ESP8266 Chip on the Node MCU v3 development board. The Sensors used inside the device can be seen in the following table with their measured quantities.

| Board Name | Sensor Name  | Metric | Units |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| DEBO Sens BME860  | Bosch BME860 | Temperature, Humidity, Air Pressure | Â°C, rel.Humid., mPas   |
| GUVA-S12SD        | GUVA-S12SD   | UVA / UVB                           | UV Index               |
| DEBO BH1750       | BH 1750      | Luminous flux                       | lm                     |
| DEBO Sens CCS811  | CCS811       | CO2, TVOC                           | ppm, ppb               |
